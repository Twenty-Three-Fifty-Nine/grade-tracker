# Twenty Three Fifty Nine

> Abdulrahman Asfari and Chris Sa

## About

This was created as a summer project in preparation for our third year of university. The idea was suggested to us as we couldn't find a decent way to track grades. Chris had a spreadsheet but it was a pain to update and so we decided to make 23:59.

### The name

The name Twenty Three Fifty Nine (2359) came around after a lot of discussions. The idea behind the name is that a lot of students hand in their work at the last minute and so we thought it was a fitting name to track grades.

## How did we make 2359?

### Front end

The front end of the website is made using ReactJS and the MUI package. This combination made it easier to quickly develop, and have things look great at the same time.

Chris has done web development before but not using a framework and this was Abdulrahman's first time, so there was a lot to learn about UX and UI design.

### Back end

The back end started as a local NodeJS server but was soon migrated to AWS after Chris got his Cloud Practitioner certification and showed Abdulrahman around while completing the move. It is run in a completely serverless environment and fits mostly within the free tier.

## Future

We plan to continue the development of this website and are open to suggestions as to how we can improve it.
